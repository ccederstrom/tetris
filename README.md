======

Tetris is a puzzle video game created by Alexey Pazhitnov in 1984.  Tetris has become very popular and is currently available to virtually any consoles, computers, mobile phones, etc.  The Tetris game is based off the popular concept of tetrominoes.  

The goal of the game is to manipulate tetrominoes by rotating them in 90 degree increments, moving them sideways while they fall with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. Once you have successfully created a horizontal line, the line then disappears.  The tetrominoes fall faster as the game increases in difficulty.  The game is over when the tetrominoes stack all the way up and there is no more room for more tetrominoes.
